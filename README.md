# Subdomain Enumeration Tool

## Overview
The **Subdomain Enumeration Tool** is a Python-based utility that allows users to identify subdomains of a given domain, resolve their IP addresses, check for potential subdomain takeover vulnerabilities, and verify the presence of HTTPS support. This tool can be useful for penetration testers, security researchers, and anyone interested in gaining insights into a domain's subdomains.

## Features
- Resolves DNS records (A and CNAME) for a list of subdomains.
- Checks for potential subdomain takeovers (e.g., for GitHub Pages, AWS S3).
- Verifies if subdomains support HTTPS.
- Outputs results in JSON and CSV formats.
- Concurrently processes multiple subdomains for faster enumeration.

## Requirements

Before using the tool, ensure the following Python packages are installed:

- `requests`
- `dnspython`
- `concurrent.futures`

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests dnspython
```

## Usage

### 1. Install Python dependencies
Make sure all necessary libraries are installed by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Sublist3r
Before running the script, you need to generate a file containing subdomains using [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r):
```bash
sublist3r -d example.com -o example_com_subdomains.txt
```

### 3. Run the Subdomain Enumeration Tool
Once you have generated a subdomains file using Sublist3r, run the Python script:

```bash
python3 subdomain-enumeration-tool.py
```

When prompted, enter the domain name (e.g., `example.com`) to scan.

### 4. Output
The script will output two files:
- A JSON file (`example_com_subdomains.json`) containing subdomain information (IPs, CNAMEs, and takeover status).
- A CSV file (`example_com_subdomains.csv`) for easy viewing and sharing.

## Example

```bash
Enter domain to scan: example.com
[+] Enumerating subdomains for: example.com
[+] Loaded 50 subdomains from example_com_subdomains.txt
[+] Checking subdomain: www.example.com
[+] www.example.com is live, IP: [93.184.216.34]
[+] www.example.com has a CNAME record: example.com.edgekey.net.
...
[+] Results saved to example_com_subdomains.json
[+] Results saved to example_com_subdomains.csv
```
